This python script can launch 4 videos according to the button pressed on the raspberry Pi

If a button is pressed before a video ended, the video is stopped. So you have only one video at once.

Videos must be in the folder **/home/pi/Videos**
  - /home/pi/Videos/1.mp4 -> will be launch by button 1
  - /home/pi/Videos/2.mp4 -> will be launch by button 2, etc...
